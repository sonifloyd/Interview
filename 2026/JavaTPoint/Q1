class Test   
{  
    public static void main (String args[])   
    {  
        System.out.println(10 * 20 + "Tpointtech");   
        System.out.println("Tpointtech" + 10 * 20);  
    }  
}  

First Line
System.out.println(10 * 20 + "Tpointtech");

Step 1: Operator precedence

* has higher precedence than +.

So first:

10 * 20 = 200


Now expression becomes:

200 + "Tpointtech"


Since one operand is String → concatenation happens.

✅ Output:
200Tpointtech

🔹 Second Line
System.out.println("Tpointtech" + 10 * 20);


Now here many students get confused 🔥

Again, * has higher precedence than +.

So Java first calculates:

10 * 20 = 200


Then expression becomes:

"Tpointtech" + 200


Now String concatenation happens.

✅ Output:
Tpointtech200

🎯 Final Output
200Tpointtech
Tpointtech200

🔥 Important Rule for Interview

Operator precedence order:

1. *, /, %
2. +, -
3. String concatenation (if String present)


So multiplication always happens before concatenation.

⚠️ Very Important Trick

If you write:

System.out.println("Tpointtech" + 10 + 20);


Output:

Tpointtech1020


But if you write:

System.out.println("Tpointtech" + (10 + 20));


Output:

Tpointtech30


👉 Brackets change everything.
