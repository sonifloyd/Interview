What is OOPS?

OOPS = Object-Oriented Programming System

It is based on 4 main concepts:

Encapsulation

Abstraction

Inheritance

Polymorphism

Abstraction means hiding implementation details and showing only important features.
When you use an ATM machine:

You insert card

Enter PIN

Select Withdraw

Get cash

👉 You don’t know:

How bank server validates PIN

How balance is checked

How machine counts notes

How transaction is logged

You only see important features (Withdraw, Deposit, Check Balance).
The implementation is hidden.
In Java, Abstraction can be achieved in two main ways:

1️⃣ Using Abstract Class
2️⃣ Using Interface

🔹 1️⃣ Using Abstract Class

An abstract class can have:

Abstract methods (no body)

Normal methods (with body)

Variables

Constructors
