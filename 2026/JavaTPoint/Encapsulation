Encapsulation means binding data (variables) 
and methods together in a single unit and restricting direct access to data using access modifiers.

Data ko hide karna + control access dena = Encapsulation

How to Achieve Encapsulation in Java?
1️⃣ Make variables private
2️⃣ Provide public getter & setter methods



Encapsulation vs Abstraction (Very Important)
Encapsulation	Abstraction
Hides data	Hides implementation
Achieved using private variables	Achieved using abstract class/interface
Focus on security	Focus on design

You cannot directly change your bank balance.
You must use:
deposit()
withdraw()
Balance is hidden.
That is Encapsulation.
