class Animal {    
    Animal() { 
        System.out.println("An animal is created"); 
    }    
}    

class Dog extends Animal {    
    Dog(){    
        System.out.println("A dog is created");     
    }    
}    

class Main {    
    public static void main(String args[]) {    
        Dog d = new Dog();    
    }    
}
---------------
Execution Flow (Step by Step)
Step 1️⃣

Program starts from:

main()

Step 2️⃣

This line runs:

Dog d = new Dog();


Now object creation starts.

Step 3️⃣

Before Dog() constructor runs,
Java automatically calls parent constructor first.

Internally Java adds:

super();


So actual Dog constructor becomes:

Dog() {
    super();   // automatically added
    System.out.println("A dog is created");
}

Step 4️⃣

Now execution order:

Animal() constructor runs
→ prints:

An animal is created


Then Dog() constructor runs
→ prints:

A dog is created

✅ Final Output
An animal is created
A dog is created

🔥 Important Rule (Very Interview Important)

👉 Parent class constructor runs first.
👉 Then child class constructor runs.
👉 super() is automatically inserted by compiler.

🎯 Why?

Because:

Child class inherits parent properties.

So parent must be initialized first.

🔥 Visual Flow
main()
   ↓
new Dog()
   ↓
Animal() constructor
   ↓
Dog() constructor

🎯 Interview One-Line Answer

“When a child class object is created, the parent class constructor is executed first due to implicit super() call.”
