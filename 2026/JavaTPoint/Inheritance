Inheritance in Java
✅ Definition (Interview Line)

Inheritance is a mechanism where one class acquires the properties and behavior of another class using the extends keyword.

class Animal {

    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Animal is eating");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {

    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog is barking");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Dog d = new Dog();

        d.eat();   // inherited method
        d.bark();  // own method
    }
}
🖥 Output
Animal is eating
Dog is barking
🔥 What Happened Here?
Dog extends Animal

So Dog gets eat() automatically

No need to rewrite code

👉 This improves code reusability

🔹 Types of Inheritance in Java
Type	Supported?
Single	✅ Yes
Multilevel	✅ Yes
Hierarchical	✅ Yes
Multiple (class to class)	❌ No
Multiple (using interface)	✅ Yes
🔥 Example of Multilevel
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Eating");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Barking");
    }
}

class Puppy extends Dog {
    void weep() {
        System.out.println("Weeping");
    }
}
Puppy now has:

eat()

bark()

weep()

🎯 Interview Short Answer
Inheritance allows a child class to reuse the properties and methods of a parent class. 
It is achieved using the extends keyword and promotes code reusability.

How Inheritance is Achieved in Java?

👉 Using the extends keyword (for classes)
👉 Using the implements keyword (for interfaces)
