Can we declare an interface as final? -> n0
so, the compiler will show an error.

q2.---
Class Test   
{  
    public static void main (String args[])   
    {  
        System.out.println(10 + 20 + "Tpointtech");   
        System.out.println("Tpointtech" + 10 + 20);  
    }  
} 

How Java evaluates this:

Java evaluates left to right.

Step 1:

10 + 20 = 30   (integer addition)


Step 2:

30 + "Tpointtech"


Now since one operand is a String, Java performs String concatenation.

So output becomes:

30Tpointtech

🔹 Second Line
System.out.println("Tpointtech" + 10 + 20);

👉 How Java evaluates this:

Step 1:

"Tpointtech" + 10


When String comes first, everything after becomes String.

So:

"Tpointtech10"


Step 2:

"Tpointtech10" + 20


Result:

Tpointtech1020

✅ Final Output
30Tpointtech
Tpointtech1020

🔥 Important Interview Rule

👉 If String comes first, everything becomes String.

👉 If numbers come first, they add normally until a String appears.
