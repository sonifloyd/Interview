“Static variable belongs to class and is shared among all objects.”

Why main() Method is Static?
public static void main(String[] args)

👉 Reason:

JVM calls main() method without creating object.

Since no object is created at the start of program,
main() must be static so JVM can call it directly using class name.

🔥 How JVM Calls main()

Internally JVM does something like:

Main.main(args);


Not like:

new Main().main(args); ❌


Because no object exists yet.

🔹 What If main() is Not Static?

Example:

public class Main {
    public void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello");
    }
}


Now try to run program ❌

Compile Time Error:
Error: Main method is not static in class Main


Program will NOT run.

🔥 Why JVM Needs static?

Because:

Program execution starts from main()

No object exists before program starts

So JVM cannot create object automatically

Therefore main() must belong to class → static

🔹 Simple Real-Life Example

Think:

Class = Blueprint of house
Object = Real house

Before building house (object),
You need entry point (main).

So entry point must exist without object.

🎯 One-Line Interview Answer

“Main method is static because JVM calls it without creating object of the class.”

🔥 Extra Knowledge

main() must be:

public → JVM must access it

static → No object required

void → Does not return anything

String[] args → For command-line arguments

If you want, I can also explain:

Can we overload main method?

Can main be private?

Can we run program without main? 😄
