Difference Between final Method and abstract Method in Java
Feature	final Method	abstract Method
Body (Implementation)	Has complete implementation	Has no body (only declaration)
Overriding	❌ Cannot be overridden	✅ Must be overridden in subclass
Purpose	Prevent modification of behavior	Force subclass to provide implementation
Used In	Normal class	Abstract class (or interface)
Keyword Meaning	“Don’t change this method”	“You must implement this method”
--
class Parent {
    final void show() {
        System.out.println("This is final method");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    // void show() { } ❌ ERROR - Cannot override final method
}
show() method already implemented.
Child class cannot override it.
Used when you want fixed behavior.
-----

abstract class Parent {
    abstract void show();   // no body
}

class Child extends Parent {
    void show() {          // must implement
        System.out.println("Implemented in child");
    }
}
--
Method has no body.
Child class must override it.
Used when behavior depends on subclass.

You cannot write:
abstract final void show(); // ❌ Invalid
