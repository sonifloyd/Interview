-------------------------
Variables in Your Code
int rollno;          // instance variable
String name;         // instance variable
static final String COLLEGE = "ITS";   // static + final variable

🔹 What Does static final Mean?
✅ static

Belongs to class

Shared by all objects

Only one copy in memory

✅ final

Value cannot be changed

Becomes constant

So:

static final String COLLEGE = "ITS";


👉 Means:

All students have same college

It cannot be modified

Only one copy exists

🔹 Object Creation
Main obj1 = new Main (111, "Karan");
Main obj2 = new Main(222, "Aryan");


Constructor assigns:

obj1 → rollno = 111, name = Karan
obj2 → rollno = 222, name = Aryan


But COLLEGE is shared.

🔹 display() Method
System.out.println(rollno + " " + name + " " + COLLEGE);


For obj1:

111 Karan ITS


For obj2:

222 Aryan ITS

✅ Final Output
111 Karan ITS
222 Aryan ITS

🔥 Important Interview Points

static variable → shared among all objects

final variable → cannot be changed

static final → constant

-----------------------------
Step 1: Program Starts
public static void main(String[] args)


Execution starts from main().

🔹 Step 2: First Object Created
Main obj1 = new Main(111, "Karan");


👉 Constructor runs:

Main(int r, String n) {
    rollno = r;     // 111
    name = n;       // "Karan"
}


So:

obj1.rollno = 111
obj1.name = Karan
COLLEGE = ITS  (shared, already fixed)

🔹 Step 3: Second Object Created
Main obj2 = new Main(222, "Aryan");


Constructor runs again:

obj2.rollno = 222
obj2.name = Aryan
COLLEGE = ITS (same shared copy)

🔹 Step 4: First Display Call
obj1.display();


Prints:

111 Karan ITS

🔹 Step 5: Second Display Call
obj2.display();


Prints:

222 Aryan ITS

✅ Final Output on Console
111 Karan ITS
222 Aryan ITS

🔥 Execution Flow Summary

main() starts

obj1 created → constructor runs

obj2 created → constructor runs

obj1.display() prints

obj2.display() prints

If you want, I can also draw memory diagram to show how static variable is stored separately 😄
