What is Page Object Model (POM) in Selenium?
Page Object Model (POM) is a design pattern in Selenium that helps to maintain test scripts by separating the test logic from the web elements. 
It makes automation frameworks more maintainable, reusable, and scalable.

How can we run testcases in paralle in cucumber 

<suite name="Cucumber Suite" parallel="methods" thread-count="3">
    <test name="Cucumber Test">
        <classes>
            <class name="runner.TestRunner"/>
        </classes>
    </test>
</suite>

parallel="methods" means each scenario runs in parallel.
ðŸ‘‰ thread-count="3" specifies the number of threads to use.

List<String> windows = new ArrayList<>(windowHandles); // converted to arraylist b/c of indexing 

// Switch to the 3rd window (index 2)
driver.switchTo().window(windows.get(2)); 

// Switch back to the 1st window (index 0)
