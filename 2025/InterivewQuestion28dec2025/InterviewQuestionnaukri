What are the different dashboards in JIRA?
Ans. Different dashboards in JIRA include Agile, Scrum, Kanban, and Burndown charts.
Agile dashboard: Provides an overview of the project's progress using Agile methodologies.

Scrum dashboard: Focuses on sprint planning, backlog management, and team performance.

Kanban dashboard: Visualizes work in progress, bottlenecks, and cycle time.

Burndown charts: Shows the remaining work in a sprint or project over time.


Explain the difference between REST and SOAP APIs with real-world examples.
Ans. REST is an architectural style using HTTP, while SOAP is a protocol with strict standards for web services.
REST uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for communication.

SOAP relies on XML and has a strict messaging protocol, often using HTTP or SMTP.

REST is stateless, meaning each request from a client contains all the information needed to process it.

SOAP supports stateful operations, allowing for complex transactions.

REST is generally easier to use and more flexible, making it suitable for web applications like Twitter API.

SOAP is often used in enterprise-level applications requiring high security and ACID compliance, such as banking services.



What is synchronization in Selenium, and how do you implement it to handle timing issues during test execution?
Ans. Understanding synchronization in Selenium to handle timing issues during test execution
Approach
Identify timing issues such as elements not being immediately available or interactions attempted before page load.
Use implicit waits to specify a default waiting time for the WebDriver to poll the DOM for elements before throwing an exception.
Use explicit waits to wait for specific conditions to occur before proceeding, such as waiting for visibility or clickability of an element.
Use fluent waits for more fine-grained control over polling intervals and exception handling during wait periods.
Apply appropriate wait strategy based on test scenario to ensure robust test execution without unnecessary delays.
java

import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebElement;
import org.openqa.selenium.support.ui.WebDriverWait;
import org.openqa.selenium.support.ui.ExpectedConditions;
import org.openqa.selenium.By;
import java.time.Duration;
import org.openqa.selenium.support.ui.FluentWait;
import java.util.function.Function;

// Implicit wait
// driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.ofSeconds(10));

// Explicit wait example
WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, Duration.ofSeconds(10));
WebElement element = wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.id("elementId")));

// Fluent wait example
FluentWait<WebDriver> fluentWait = new FluentWait<>(driver)
  .withTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(15))
  .pollingEvery(Duration.ofSeconds(2))
  .ignoring(org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException.class);

WebElement fluentElement = fluentWait.until(new Function<WebDriver, WebElement>() {
    public WebElement apply(WebDriver driver) {
        return driver.findElement(By.id("elementId"));
    }
});


hat is the difference between element and elements?
Ans. Element is a singular object, while elements refer to multiple objects.
Element is a single item in a collection or array.

Elements are multiple items in a collection or array.

Example: 'apple' is an element in the array ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'].

Example: 'banana' and 'orange' are elements in the same array.



Q. What is the difference between schema and database testing?
Ans. Schema testing focuses on the structure of the database, while database testing focuses on the data within the database.
Schema testing ensures that the database tables, columns, relationships, and constraints are correctly defined.

Database testing involves verifying the data stored in the database, such as data integrity, accuracy, and consistency.

Schema testing is more focused on the design and structure of the database, while database testing is more concerned with the content and functionality.

Examples of schema testing include checking for proper data types, constraints, and indexes, while database testing may involve validating data migrations, CRUD operations, and data retrieval.

Both types of testing are important for ensuring the overall quality and reliability of the database.

Describe the ACID properties in the context of SQL databases. Provide examples of how each property is ensured.
Ans. ACID properties ensure reliable processing of database transactions, maintaining data integrity and consistency.
Atomicity: Transactions are all-or-nothing. Example: If a bank transfer fails, no money is deducted or added.

Consistency: Transactions bring the database from one valid state to another. Example: A transaction must not violate any database rules.

Isolation: Transactions occur independently. Example: Two transactions should not interfere with each other, ensuring data integrity.

Durability: Once a transaction is committed, it remains so even in case of a system failure. Example: A completed order remains in the database.
Q. Tell me the edge cases you would consider while designing the signup flow.
Ans. Consider various edge cases in signup flow to ensure a seamless user experience and robust system performance.
User enters invalid email format (e.g., missing '@' symbol).

User tries to sign up with an already registered email address.

User's password does not meet security criteria (e.g., too short, lacks special characters).

User attempts to sign up from a region where the service is not available.

User's session times out while filling out the form, leading to data loss.

User tries to sign up using a temporary or disposable email address.

User's internet connection drops during the signup process.

User enters a phone number in an unsupported format or country code.
