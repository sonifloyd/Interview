# Interview
Tip 1 : You must confidence over Data Structures and its concepts. Pick one coding platform and try to practice at least 5-6 coding questions everyday.
I completed around 200+ questions on Leetcode, 200+ questions on Geek For Geeks.
Tip 2 : Not attempting the question is enough. try to analyze its time and space complexity. See, if you can further optimize your solution. Sometimes the 
interviewer asks only one question and keep on increasing its difficulty by asking for its optmization.
Tip 3 : Apart from coding questions keep studying concepts of Operating Systems, databases and object oriented programming. You can always refer to Geeks For
Geeks articles for it. Also, Coding Ninja's Data Structures and algorithms course in C++ helped me a lot 
in improving my OOPS concepts specifically.

RESUME TIP
Tip 1 : A few good projects will do the work
Tip 2 : Provide links of coding platform you are doing well
RESUME TIP
Tip 1 : Do not put false things on resume.
Tip 2 : You should have good projects to showcase.

RESUME TIP
Tip 1 : Do not mention any skills, projects or achievements which you haven't completed yourselves. If you are not able to answer the basic questions it leaves a bad impact.
Tip 2 : You do need to have a lot of projects. Only one good project with proper knowledge is also fine. The same goes for the skills as well.
Tip 3 : Try to write achievements which shows your technical skills, communication skills, leadership quality or teamwork.
